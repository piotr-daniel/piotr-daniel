# Hello!

- I'm currently building [Qnote](https://github.com/piotr-daniel/qnote) - a quick and easy note taking TUI & CLI software!

- Recently I've launched a fun [Heartbeat Server](https://github.com/piotr-daniel/heartbeat) ❤️ - a living, breathing FastAPI app that tracks its own life.

- What I love working on is automation, data, productivity tools, and genrally making things work.
