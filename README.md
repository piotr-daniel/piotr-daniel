# Hello!

I'm currently building [Heartbeat Server](https://github.com/piotr-daniel/heartbeat) ❤️ — a living, breathing FastAPI app that tracks its own life.

## What I Love Working On

- 🧪 **FastAPI** and **Django** projects — structured, well-documented, and testable  
- 📊 **Data analytics** with Python — from cleaning to visualization  
- 🛠️ **Developer** tools that reduce complexity and help others learn faster  
- 🧠 **Automating** boring stuff, problems solving, puzzles & riddles
- 🧰 **Making things work** and anything that's fun
